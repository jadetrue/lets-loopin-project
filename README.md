# Loopin Mood Card

![Mood Card](https://github.com/jadetruexo/lets-loopin-project/blob/main/mood.jpg?raw=true)

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A React component that takes a prop of `mood` that takes four values; `"happy" | "neutral" | "sad" | undefined`
- [ ] The component renders one of the four states listed above depending on the value of that prop
- [ ] Can I click a button to submit my mood if I haven't submitted my mood yet?
- [ ] The component also takes a prop of `date` and displays that back to the user
- [ ] Do we have a suite of [test](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or [stories](https://storybook.js.org/) for each component used?
- [ ] Is the code repository available to download on Github?
- [ ] **Stretch goal**: How will this look and work on mobile?
- [ ] **Stretch goal**:
      Add an animation to the component to make it pop; maybe the text bounces or slowly gains opacity on its first render.
- [ ] **Stretch goal**:
      Are there any other features you'd like to see in a daily mood tracker? You don't have to actually built them, but understanding your ideas would great - add comments in the code to explain future ideas

## Built with

- CSS (Sass & BEM)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React

## What I have learnt & would like to improve

- I've revisted React and loved working with props to set the mood.
- I would like to change the 'btn' block to be a component in itself to be reused elsewhere if needed.
- Also to be able to chain this up so the buttons do not display if the mood isn't selected.
- Found some fancy border styles online! Ref: https://codepen.io/tmrDevelops/pen/VeRvKX.
- I would have liked to have changed the date to a prop, and had a completed test case using it this way.
- I would have liked to have been able to render the component with both props.
